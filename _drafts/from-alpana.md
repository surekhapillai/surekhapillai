I'd first interacted with Surekha when she was coordinating relief work in Delhi and had a couple of exchanges on book recommendations for her daughter. We didn't know each other but I feel like I got to know her through the warm, kind, encouraging, funny conversations she'd have with others that would show up on my timeline.

I felt like I was seeing the beauty of the world around her through her photos and posts on food, her daughter's drawings, the poetry snippets, the views from her kitchen window. She would sometimes just ask people how they are and respond with such kindness and grace. Her presence was an affirmation of all that is good. If us strangers are feeling such grief, I cannot imagine what her and family and daughter must be going through. I hope her daughter knows how kind, beautiful and phenomenal Surekha was. May her soul rest in peace. ðŸ–¤


I'm sharing my favourite poem and a view from my window for her because I think she would have liked them. 

### The Quiet World
#### By Jeffrey McDaneil

*In an effort to get people to look
into each otherâ€™s eyes more,
and also to appease the mutes,
the government has decided
to allot each person exactly one hundred   
and sixty-seven words, per day.*

*When the phone rings, I put it to my ear   
without saying hello. In the restaurant   
I point at chicken noodle soup.
I am adjusting well to the new way.*

*Late at night, I call my long distance lover,   
proudly say I only used fifty-nine today.   
I saved the rest for you.*

*When she doesnâ€™t respond,
I know sheâ€™s used up all her words,   
so I slowly whisper I love you
thirty-two and a third times.
After that, we just sit on the line   
and listen to each other breathe.*
