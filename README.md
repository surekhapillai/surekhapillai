# Tributes for Surekha Pillai

An amazing person named Surekha Pillai (@surekha on Twitter) passed away on 11th June 2021 after a battle with Covid.

She had once joked about wanting to hear the nice things people would say about her once she was gone. So here’s a small collection — maybe she’ll get to read them from wherever she is.
