In June 2021, we asked people on Twitter to share notes and tributes for Surekha via email to be put up on this page. Several persons responded and wrote in. Probably, you wanted to share something too and either you couldn't send in due to personal reasons or you were not on Twitter so you missed the memo. In any case, for whatever reason, if you couldn't contribute earlier, but want to do so now, you CAN!

You can send text, art, pictures, poems, recipes (Surekha _loved_ food!)..anything that you want to share to keep her legacy alive. You can mention your name and/or social media handle along with whatever you send.

Please send to this id: [surekha-pillai-tributes@googlegroups.com](mailto:surekha-pillai-tributes@googlegroups.com)
