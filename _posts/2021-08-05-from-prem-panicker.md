My dear S…

It’s odd, the kind of things the mind snags on in its wanderings through memory, but… I always wanted to ask you this: Why is it that in the eight-odd years of knowing each other, you never ever called me by my name?

Why is it always “Mr P”?

Sorry — not “is”, “was”. (I’m never going to get used to thinking of you in the past tense.)

Speaking of memory — remember a day late in December 2019 when we were a bit early to meet someone who wanted time with you, and we decided to while away a half hour at a small tea-shop on the way?

I was carrying a bagful of books for that street library you helped the Jamia kids start — most of them courtesy a very good friend of both of us, plus a few others that I’d bought at Bahrison’s before coming to meet you.

You upended the books on the tea-stained table we were sharing, pawed through them, and picked out one: a collection of Maya Angelou’s poems. Typical — given the choice, you always reached for poetry, didn’t you?

Do you remember the one you stopped at, as you flipped through those pages? The one you read, quietly, to yourself, and then sat staring at a tattered Shah Rukh Khan poster on the opposite wall, lost in your own world while an unsightly layer of scum formed on your forgotten glass of tea?

Today — less than 24 hours after you arbitrarily decided to disappear from our midst — I remember that day, that time, that poem. A particularly apposite bit:

> When great souls die,
> the air around us becomes
> light, rare, sterile.
> We breathe, briefly.
> Our eyes, briefly,
> see with
> a hurtful clarity.
> Our memory, suddenly sharpened,
> examines,
> gnaws on kind words
> unsaid,
> promised walks
> never taken.

That is so many of us today. I was trawling through Twitter, specifically the hashtag #Surekha, and reading the many tear-drenched tributes coming your way from the hundreds whose lives you touched — and seeing, “with a hurtful clarity”, that we never realised who you truly were till it was way too late.

And because that is how the mind works, pinballing between memory and the immediate moment, my memory examines those promises left unfulfilled. We were supposed to do a cook-off, remember? Your mutton curry against my Kerala-style fish curry? We would have done it that trip, if only we could have agreed on an impartial judge — and now it is too late.

There is much I want to say — have wanted to say all these years, if only I could have found adequate words. What was that you said to me once? “Instead of wasting your time writing about stupid cricket…”? I write about stupid games, S, because I lack the skill to write about the truly meaningful. The skill — and the words. So I’m going to cheat, and let Angelou speak for me yet again:

> And when great souls die,
> after a period peace blooms,
> slowly and always
> irregularly. Spaces fill
> with a kind of
> soothing electric vibration.
> Our senses, restored, never
> to be the same, whisper to us.
> They existed. They existed.
> We can be. Be and be
> better. For they existed.

That’s it. You existed. And we, all of us who you touched with your kindness, your understated grace, your unstinted affection, we can be, and we can be better. Because you existed.

You will wince, as you always have, on reading these two last words, but they need saying: Thank you!

With pride in the knowledge that you were — are — a friend, and with immense affection

“Mr P”

PS: You asked me for a hand-written letter, no? Here it is. This one. Which I wrote by hand just now before transcribing it onto my laptop, and which I will keep in a safe place to hand over to you, in person, when we meet on the other side. As we will.
