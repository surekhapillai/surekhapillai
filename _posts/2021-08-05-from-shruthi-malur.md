title: From Shruthi Malur
excerpt: ''

---
Surekha embraced everyone and provided a tired fellow traveler of life like me a place to rest, much like the trees she loved. She was an ocean of giving so I could harbor my deepest secrets knowing that it was a safe space without fear or judgements.

She taught me to live in the moment and not to be burdened with the baggage we so fondly carry with ourselves everywhere we go. She loved broken things and broken people (like me) and mended it with her warmth and hugs. She was always the first to help, and to raise her voice against injustices that frequently went on. She wasn’t just my Surekha, she touched so many lives in her own, special, beautiful way.

I’ve known Surekha only via Twitter but she’s left a lasting impact on me. I will continue to hug trees, wear monkey caps, colorful earrings and carry ample love in my heart to keep her memory alive. You went before I could know you or see you in person, Surekha. Rest In Peace, and love my dearest friend.
