The day I entered the twitter world, I got scared. I felt it was such an angry space.the one person who made me stay there was Surekha.
I used to love her lunch menu photos.It just felt so real. Her posts made me feel less scared.

I reached out to her when she was setting up the library, I shipped a few books to her. She very gently nudged me to send my own book (words matter ) to her and I did not have the courage to do that.

Surekha was someone who kept my idea and ideals of India still alive. That was one the few messages I exchanged with her.Always only through DM. because posting anything on twitter is still very frightening.

She was someone I felt was human and just herself. Even when I heard that she had passed away, I donâ€™t know why, I still could only DM her.
I could not speak at the remembrance that was organized on Sunday. I did not have the confidence to speak about her amongst a set of people who know her intimately.

I can still feel that I can DM her with courage and just feel that she must be seeing it from somewhere rather than actually putting out something on twitter itself.

I am just glad I knew her even if fleetingly, she added a layer of courage and welcomed me in her own into her world.

We were hoping to meet in Bangalore, it was not to be. She will remain the one person who made twitter a place to come to for someone like me. She kept the idea of my country and her activism alive for me.I thank her for that.
