I think I can best describe Surekha as our Twitter mommy.

She cared, she loved, she cheered on, she encouraged, she scolded. She followed through on things and she connected truly. She knew how to listen in a way few people do. She was genuinely warm. She never shied away from speaking out. She would feel someone’s pain as her own. She would invest in understanding people and the place they were coming from. She was authentic. One of a kind. Real. Her compassion and empathy is what I will remember most. In one of our Twitter conversations on DM she told me, “Your love always falls on me like gentle rain.”

I will always love you like gentle rain, Surekha. I will never forget you.
