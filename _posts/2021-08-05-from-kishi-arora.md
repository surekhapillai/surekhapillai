This is S - my darling S❤️

Surekha as in ‘The SUREKHA PILLAI’ from Twitter. ️

Covid is a thief, stole one of my most treasured friend from me.

I have always said I am a fortunate girl because I have equivalents of blessing as close friends. Today it’s one less I count on my fingertip. And I am mad. My heart feels bad-very bad. I hurt that she didn’t get to see the last message that said I love you-S; that always got me a 😘back. 💔

She had sent this Voice Message (play-it's in the first photo) to cheer me up on a day I was down in the dumps. So typical S, and that is what she did, lift anyone, and I mean anyone (check Twitter) to get back on track. To remind them that they are worth so much more.

A friend asked me, how come you both hit it off? I don’t know, it may be because we are broken people. Pain attracts pain. We love food(hardcore meat-eater her and vegetarian me), alcohol, esp beer, stupid jokes, plants, Dilli Haat, and randomly sitting in Anokhi shop in khan market to say they should pay us and observe people in the AC, of course! Someday I will share the crazy things we did.

Kish-in life, when you give X, life gives you 10X back, my darling. It’s a lesson I learned from her. S was the richest giver I know, I mean, a solid champion. Be it giving her time, love, a shoulder to cry on, advice, affection, or even scoldings. Givers are the happiest people, even in sadness. She understood one's NEED, so she gave more. Where will I ever find a lover of life like this? How will I ever get those 10 min long hugs & my mom would say, bus karo, come eat? Who will be my maavu supplier or feed me dosai with a kiss on the forehead? Or who will tell me there will be bad days, bad times, but it's okay, you will always bounce back, betty doll, you know you are my precious?

I HATE the idea of talking in past tense about her, and I NEVER will. She will stay with me till the day I die - in my heart in that extra unique space, in the plants on my terrace that she left me, the doll that V made and S gifted before she left for Bombay. The irony is even though I say all this, what I need most is my S, who says, 'you are okay, you will be okay. I'm here.' 😭
