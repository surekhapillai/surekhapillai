Where does one even begin when it comes to talking about Surekha? These are not words I thought I'd be typing or even thinking of. I've known Surekha since 2009. A happy face, kind words, a sunflower that stood tall amongst a growing pack of weeds. My interactions with her, right from when I was a teenager, have only been positive, if not bursting with energy.

Surekha was always encouraging, always thoughtful and always, always, kind. Her kindness had no bounds. She gave so much more than any of us and without any second thought. She believed in the goodness of people. I am grateful to have known her, to benefited from her words, and to have caught a piece of her beautiful light. There are so many lessons to take from her life and the way she chose to live it, but the one that I will hold on to, is to be kind. It is a lesson I've forgotten more than once in the past, but will not anymore.

Surekha, I know you're watching us all, and I miss you terribly.
