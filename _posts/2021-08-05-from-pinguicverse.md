Losing @surekha has been the hardest part of 2021 for me. She is my ally, advocate, mentor, friend, and sister. I have never told her any of this. I wish I did.

My initial interaction with her, like most of us, was when I was in distress, and she came in with her Surekha hugs. When I found out I am autistic, and told her, she did not feel sorry for me. She celebrated each person for who they are.

I would often DM her about my Pinguic moments and we would laugh about how similar I am to lil V.

She repeatedly told me how happy she was that V and I were so similar and V would potentially grow up to be like me. Do you know how rare it is for a parent to tell a ND person "I want my child to be like you"? Everyone wants the opposite of us.

Over pictures of flowers, trees, nosepins, food, she taught me to be the best version of myself. "You will fill all the spaces with your heart", she told me when I had my imposter moments.

Right now my heart is full. But I hope I will be able to carry forward your teachings and make you proud. Meanwhile, here are some foraged flowers for the person who loved simple and beautiful things. I love you, Chechi. I know you love me too. RIP.
