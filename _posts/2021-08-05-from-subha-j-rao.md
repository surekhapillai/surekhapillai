Surekha was that rare voice on Twitter who knew how to make a point and put forth an opinion without hurting anyone else. She took you along, never making you feel like a lesser person.

She gave so many of us an opportunity to help those in need, and all we needed was her presence to know this was a cause worth backing. On a platform that was increasingly becoming a cesspool, she was a clear stream. A handle and person who got everyone to smile and live life the way it was meant to be. With heart. Go well, Surekha. Our world is lesser without you.
