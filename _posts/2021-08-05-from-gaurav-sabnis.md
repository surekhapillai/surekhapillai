I spent much of this July outdoors and missed Surekha intensely. Because any time I posted a picture of a campfire or birds or trees or insects, Surekha's effervescent smile and big soulful eyes would appear in my mention making plans for when we would do it together soon.

I don't think I'll ever be able to spend a day outdoors without thinking of Surekha.

A few days ago, a friend of mine (@curiousgawker on Twitter) and I hugged each other on the streets of Manhattan and cried that we would never be able to hang out with Surekha. And neither of us has ever met her. But she touched our lives remotely in a way that she felt like a lifelong friend.

Surekha was the purest distillation of all that is good about our species. And I will miss her forever.
