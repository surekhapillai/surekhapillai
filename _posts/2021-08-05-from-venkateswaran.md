I had the privilege of knowing Surekha only online. She did not know me personally and neither do I claim to know her so. But our interactions were always real. Because she was a real person and her real heart was easy to see even online.

She would remember song recommendations I gave which I had forgotten 4 years after I had suggested them. One song was vandhaale allippoo. The fragrance of the allippoo remains even after it's gone. So shall remain memories with Surekha. Rest in peace, Surekha.
