SUREKHA PILLAI - Everything beautiful floating around me reminds me of the beauty and magnificence of a mighty ship that was, and is no more. I am holding on to the beautiful arts that V creates and memories that your sister shares to float around.

Thanks beautiful soul for everything you have been. BIG HUGS
