title: "From Rumika Kurar"

For Surekha: She was one of the warmest people on Twitter, I stumbled upon her through Mint journalists that I follow and instantly felt a connection. She had such a quirky, intimate, candid, and almost poetic gaze that reading her posts always made me smile.

It is very difficult to process that she is no more even though we didn't know each other. But we had a few exchanges on Twitter and she addressed me by my name, I will always remember her for her kindness. Her love for food, art, earrings, plants/flowers, and her unabashed expressions of the same were unmatched. Her activism and angst were really inspiring as well. Hope she rests snugly in a place that deserves her.
