I see you in the trees  
In the mountains and hills  
I see you in foods, sweet and spicy  
And in people, when they smile

I see you in calls for help  
In protests that fill the streets  
I see you in music, soft or whacky  
In art, of every shade and style

I see you in everything that’s beautiful.

Because you were a beautiful person, Surekha.

You were all love – and touched everyone you interacted with, in your own special way.

You taught us life is much more than just living for one’s own self.

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for enriching our world.

Miss you.  
Will always love you.

Raja
